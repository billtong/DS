# question:
Given a set of cities and a set of flights between them (each flight with a departure time and
arrival time) your task is to find the route that starts in specified city A and ends in specified
city B, and has the earliest possible arrival time in B. The flight plan may contain any number
of flights but each flight in the route must have a departure time strictly greater than the
arrival time of the previous flight in the route.
